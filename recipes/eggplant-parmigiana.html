        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Eggplant parmigiana is one of the most popular and iconic vegetarian Italian dishes and this recipe is straight from Italy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients for two people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 pounds large eggplants, sliced lengthwise into Â¼-inch slices</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons coarse salt, or as needed</li>
            <li>10 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons flour for dredging</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a single layer of eggplant slices in a colander sitting on a plate and sprinkle with coarse salt.
                Cover with a second layer and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant.
                Place a plate on top and add a weight to put pressure on the eggplant slices. Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Rinse eggplant slices under running cold water to wash off all the salt. Pat dry on all sides with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge eggplant slices in flour on both sides and add to the hot oil, working in batches. 
                Deep fry eggplant until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook garlic and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
                Add tomato puree, 4 basil leaves, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until sauce starts to thicken, about 20 minutes.
                Remove sauce from heat. Discard garlic and stir in remaining 4 leaves basil.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Etc...</strong></li>
