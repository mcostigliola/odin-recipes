        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Yeast: active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
            <li>Bread Flour: is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. 
                This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. 
                Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</li>
            <li>Olive Oil: serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. 
                This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
            <li>Etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making process. 
                It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun intended). To shape the dough:</li>
            <li>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. 
                    This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</li>
            <li>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. 
                This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</li>
